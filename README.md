# KoyoteeScraper
Builds an epub for each book from Koyoteelaughter's subreddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Koyoteelaughter/)

* Only works if your terminal supports unicode (thanks, microsoft)

* Written for python 2.7

* Requires zipfile.py to be in the current working directory (you can get it [here](https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/2.7/Lib/zipfile.py))

* Requires praw to be installed (try `pip install praw`)

* Just run KoyScrape.py wherever you want the epubs to show up. Takes a bit to run (reddit api limitation, probably)

Made by heavily referencing jedisaber.com 's ebook tutorial

Try not to judge my code too harshly
